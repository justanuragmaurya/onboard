A project which helps businesses hire talents effortlessly using the power of AI.

Here in our project we are working on making the hiring process efforless and seamless , smooth , We are planing to using OpenAi's GPT3.5 Turbo API for the NLP part of AI. 

In this , the business owners / HRs can post a job and while posting they have to add the requirements of the job position , our AI will remember the requirements and show these job postings to the people who fullfils the requirements , the users who want job , when the register on the website have to fill a form and upload thier resume , then the AI will remember these skills and  show them job posts available based on thier reposne in the form and thier resume only. 

Once the talent applies on the job post , thier resumes and form response's details will be ranked and the top 60% will be qualified on to the the stage, in next stage our AI will create a small test based on the job's requirement and then based on the talent's accuracy and time taken , the AI will rank them and show top potential talents to the HRs / business owners, making it very easy for them to shortlist candidates for the final interviews , making the time taken for the interview to complete significatlly less.

We also plan to add further functionalities based on the projects requirements.
